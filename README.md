*Snake Game AI* 
  
  This project demonstrates an AI agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning. The agent is trained using Deep Q-Learning, a value-based method of reinforcement learning.

*Features*

  - Reinforcement Learning: The AI uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values and learns from its actions and rewards.
  
  - Game Environment: The Snake game environment is implemented using Pygame.
  
  - Training Visualization: The training progress, including scores and mean scores, is plotted using Matplotlib.
